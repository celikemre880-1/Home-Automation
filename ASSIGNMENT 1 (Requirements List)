REQUIREMENT LIST

1. Motion Detector (PIR Sensor)
•	Function: Detects human motion. If motion is detected, it sends a signal. Examples: HC-SR501 PIR sensor, Zigbee/Z-Wave motion sensors for smart homes.

3. Ambient Light Sensor (LDR or Digital Sensor)
•	Function: Detects whether the environment is bright or dark.
•	Alternative: Digital sensors that measure lux levels (e.g., BH1750).
•	The sensor determines whether it’s daylight or dark in the environment.

4. Smart Relay or Smart Bulb
•	Relay: Used to turn the light on or off based on motion and light conditions.

6. Power Supply and Connections
•	PIR and light sensors require power (typically 5V or 3.3V).
•	Relays and bulbs need electrical connections.
•	Necessary tools: Wires, breadboard, soldering kit for proper connections.

8. Smart Home Hub:
•	A hub based on Zigbee or Z-Wave integrates the motion and light sensors to control the automation.Examples: Home Assistant, SmartThings, Tuya, Xiaomi Gateway.
